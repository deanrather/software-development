​# Operations

This document aims to outline day-to-day operations, and how to work efficiently without letting important things slip.

## Day Planning

Create a Trello Card on the `Ops` Board named like: `MON 01 Jan - Person Name`
This card will be used first thing in the morning to plan your day, then throughout the day to keep tabs.

It should contain the lists:

- **Must Do** -- List of important things that must be done today
- **Should Do** -- List of less important things that should be done today

List items should be links to Trello Cards, and contain Time Spent Today and Estimated Time Left Today.

## Daily Stand-Up Meeting

- Any updates on your area (support, code quality, clients, dev team)?
- What did you do yesterday?
- What are your must-do's today?
- Are you waiting on anyone for something?
- Do you need to discuss anything with anyone?

## Interruptions

### Interrupting Others

1. If it it not urgent: use Email.
2. If it is urgent, but not important, and they have headphones on: use Instant Messaging.
3. If it is both urgent and important, interrupt them.

### Handling Interruptions

If an interruption looks like it might prevent a `Must Do` from being done today, consult with Team Leader to determine whether the interruption takes priority.
