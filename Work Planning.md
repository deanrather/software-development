# Work Planning

This document is still WIP

## Summary
![Funny comic about Estimating](http://www.curtis.lassam.net/comics/estimation_smaller.gif)

## Goal
To take an item out of the "Planning" list, and get it into the "Backlog".

## Requirements
- Should not take all day

## Process
I'm mostly just going to be rehashing [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/)'s [Natural Planning Method](http://gtd.marvelz.com/blog/2007/08/28/five-phases-of-project-planning/) and [The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People), because I think they're awesome.


1. Purpose & Principles
2. Outcome Visioning
3. Brainstorming
4. Organising
5. Determining Next Actions

>> Habit 3: Put First Things First

The primary objective is to determine what the next Key Feature is, and how to get it done.

>> Habit 4: Think Win-Win

- Ballpark Estimations

## Determining how to Get It Done

### Why
If everyone's not on the same page about why we're doing what we're doing, people can easily have conflicting opinions for the wrong reasons.

>> Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood

- Why do we need this feature?
- Why are we having this meeting?
- Why do we need an ETA?

### What

>> Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

### How

### Who

### What

Team Brainstorm
1 person develop spec first draft
team view spec
repeat prev 2 steps until happy
determine next actions

Review
- how well did we do each of the things
- "Coverage" estimating what work was involved
- "Accuracy" estimating how long each piece of work would take, also, estimating how long it would take to get done (taking into account external delays)
- "Time Taken" how long did we spend work planning
