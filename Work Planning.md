This document is still WIP

## Summary
![Funny comic about Estimating](http://www.curtis.lassam.net/comics/estimation_smaller.gif)

## Goal
To establish what big items are to be worked on for the next release

## Requirements
- Should not take all day

## Process
I'm mostly just going to be rehashing [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/)'s [Natural Planning Method](http://gtd.marvelz.com/blog/2007/08/28/five-phases-of-project-planning/) and [The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People), because I think they're awesome.

Work planning commences as soon as a production release is out-the-door.

The primary objective is to determine what the next Key Feature is, and how to get it done.

## Determining how to Get It Done

### Why
If everyone's not on the same page about why we're doing what we're doing, people can easily have conflicting opinions for the wrong reasons.

>> Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood

- Why do we need this feature?
- Why are we having this meeting?
- Why do we need an ETA?
